# traffic-screenshots

# Purpose
Quick script to capture google traffic screenshots for events or projects. The screenshots help record possible congestion issues. The screenshots ideally are made into a movie and can be used to review before/after conditions for traffic plan timing changes.


## Dependencies
- python 3.10+
- selenium
- chromedriver
- tomli
- Pillow


# .toml template
 `config-template.toml` needs to be renamed to `config.toml`. 
 `config.toml` must be configured to locations to be captured, location to store images, and file location of webdriver. Parameters are pretty self explanatory.

# Todo
- Make text larger
